	Long: `Basically this command is an alias to run git subcommand.

	In Unix you could think about this command as:
	alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dof/ --work-tree=$HOME'

	Examples:
	To run 'git --git-dir=$HOME/.dof/ --work-tree=$HOME status'
	you could just run 'dof alias status'
	
	To view the remote you would just run:
	'dof alias remote -vv'
	
	To force push to the remote you could just run:
	'dof alias push origin main --force`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		aliasCmd := *gitAlias
		aliasCmd.Args = append(aliasCmd.Args, args...)
		execCmdAndPrint(&aliasCmd)
	},
