	Use:                "alias",
	Args:               cobra.MinimumNArgs(1),
	DisableFlagParsing: true,
	Short:              "Run any git command on your dot file repository",
	Long: `Basically this command is an alias to run git subcommand.

	In Unix you could think about this command as:
	alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dof/ --work-tree=$HOME'

  This means this command can be used for any possible git command.
  But note that it's limited to the .dof repository.

	Examples:
	To run 'git --git-dir=$HOME/.dof/ --work-tree=$HOME status'
	you could just run 'dof alias status'

	To view the remote you would just run:
	'dof alias remote -vv'

	To force push to the remote you could just run:
	'dof alias push origin main --force`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		gitAlias.Args = append(gitAlias.Args, args...)
		execCmdAndPrint(gitAlias)
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(aliasCmd)
}
