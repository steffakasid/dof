This will be a simple go application to work with dot files.

## What will it be?

The idea is to create a little tool which handles all the alias stuff needed to work with a git bare repository. 
A Tutorial for a git bare repository to store dotfiles can be found here https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles

## TODO

. Initialize a repository and have a alias for git to work with it
. Add (& commit / push) new dotfiles to repository to track them
. Checkout a existing bare repository and setup the users dotfiles with all dotfiles found in repo
